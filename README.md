## 💼 Experience

### Open Source Developer | _Protocol labs_ 
*Remote | Jan 2025 – Present*

- Built high-throughput **backend services in Go for ingestion, batching, compression, and durable storage of large-scale event/log data**
-	Architected a **hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture** storing verifiable references on blockchain while persisting bulk data in decentralized object storage to reduce costs and improve scalability.
-	Implemented **peer-to-peer networking features including NAT traversal** and direct node-to-node communication without centralized servers using libp2p
-	Developed **indexed query engine with selective retrieval and progressive streaming**, enabling efficient search across large immutable datasets
-	**[PR1](https://github.com/Nkovaturient/Rachax402/pull/4)**, **[PR2](https://github.com/anuragShingare30/akave-pldg/tree/main/akavelog)**

- **Technologies:** Go, Python, Solidity, PostgreSQL, libp2p, Foundry, Decentralized Storage

--------------

### Smart Contract & Backend Engineer | _Versatile.ID_ 
*Remote | Sept 2025 – Present*

- Built a quantum-resistant identity system using ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) with a **Rust–Node.js hybrid backend cryptographic core**, enabling sub-50ms deterministic W3ID generation.
- Designed a bias-free 12-digit ID derivation pipeline using SHAKE256 entropy, keyed BLAKE3 hashing, and 48-bit rejection sampling, ensuring uniform distribution and zero collisions at scale.
- Implemented a **2-of-3 MPC non-custodial smart wallet infrastructure** via Openfort SDK with encrypted recovery sessions and no single point of failure.
- Built a multi-tenant developer SDK platform with OAuth-style auth, AES-256-GCM encrypted API keys, secure webhooks, and hardened rate-limited REST APIs.
- **Technologies:** NodeJs, Typescript, Rust, PostgreSQL, Cryptography

----

### Smart Contract & Backend Engineer | _OpenBooks_
*Remote | July 2025 – Aug 2025*

- Designed **account abstraction workflows** using PrivySDK to improve on-chain UX
- Migrated NFT minting from **Solana cNFTs to EVM-compatible NFTs** while preserving backend workflow
- Maintained backend deployment workflows on **Monad EVM**
- Contributions:
  - https://github.com/sivangbagri/openbooks-backend/pull/1
  - https://github.com/sivangbagri/openbooks-frontend/pull/1
- **Technologies:** NodeJs, Typescript, PostgreSQL

## 📌 Projects

### **Versatile.ID** | _Auth + Wallet Infrastructure_
🔗 https://www.versatile.id/

- Auth-driven wallet provisioning with Clerk webhooks, automatically generating W3IDs and MPC smart wallets on user signup
- 2-of-3 MPC non-custodial wallet infra via Openfort SDK with encrypted recovery and no single point of failure
- Multi-tenant SDK enabling third-party apps to create and manage wallets securely using OAuth-style auth and API keys
- Hardened wallet APIs with encrypted credentials, rate limiting, and secure wallet lifecycle tracking across chains

### **Akavelog - Decentralized log ingestion and Query platform**
🔗 https://github.com/anuragShingare30/akave-pldg/tree/main/akavelog

-	Designed a **decentralized observability pipeline to ingest, index, and query logs** while storing raw data immutably in content-addressed object storage
-	Built high-throughput Go ingestion service performing **normalization, batching, and compression to reduce storage and transfer overhead**
-	Implemented **indexed retrieval engine that selectively fetches relevant log batches** and streams filtered results progressively to clients
-	Developed **multi-tenant alerting and query system** with project-scoped API keys and efficient metadata indexing in PostgreSQL
- **Technologies:** Go, PostgreSQL, Akave O3(S3-Compatible), NextJs, Echo, Pgx, tern

### **Rachax402 - Verifiable Agent Coordination Protocol**
🔗 https://github.com/Nkovaturient/Rachax402/pull/4

-	Developed ERC-8004 identity and reputation smart contracts enabling on-chain agent discovery and trust scoring
-	Implemented comprehensive test suite including unit, fuzz, and invariant testing to validate protocol correctness and prevent state-corruption edge cases
-	Designed contract storage and validation logic to support verifiable off-chain task execution and attestation workflows
- **Technologies:** Solidity, Foundry, ERC-8004, EVM
